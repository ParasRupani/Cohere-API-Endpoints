"The Schapendoes numbers decreased significantly during the Second World War, along with many other European Sheepdog breeds."
"Vervets have important family units inside of groups.
One of the other reasons that ververt monkeys have been such a hot topic to research and focus on is because of their social structure. Vervets come together in troops made up of several different individuals. Females will stay in the same group for their entire lives, but males will move around to neighboring groups. This helps reduce tensions and also keep the population healthy by diversifying the gene pool – but only slightly, since groups stay close together."
"They’re threatened by deforestation.
With the rise of animal agriculture in the developed world, companies are looking for cheap food for their animals. A lot of this food comes from soy crops, and a lot of these soy crops are grown in areas of the Amazon that need to be cleared to make space for it. As such, habitats of hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions of species, are being destroyed, partitioned and reduced."

"What's for Dinner?
    
    Among the predatory species, tastes differ along with variations in jaw shape. Some mollusc eaters crush the shells of their prey and eat them whole, while others grab the extended foot of the prey and suction them out of the shell. Invertebrate eaters may pick through algae beds or dig through the muddy bottom searching for food. Species that feed on zooplankton usually filter feed in the open water. And although there are many piscivorous species of cichlids, some eat only eggs, larvae, or adults, or certain body parts of other fishes, including scales, fins, and even eyes!"
"The skink's overlapping scales help keep out dirt, sand, and other debris. Healthy adults usually shed every six weeks. Shedding takes a considerable amount of energy, greatly reducing regular food metabolism."

"Typically, tiger salamander larvae feed and grow during the spring and early summer and metamorphose 2 to 5 months after hatching. However, some populations never metamorphose. In areas where the environments surrounding permanent ponds are dry and inhospitable, they may retain certain larval characteristics that allow them to live underwater. These salamanders mature in the water and are able to reproduce, though they maintain the body of an immature salamander – a phenomenon called neoteny. Should environmental conditions improve, they may metamorphose into a terrestrial adult."
"In the wild, a male will find a high vantage point to watch over his herd of females and if he spots danger, will start alarm calling. Moments later every male in the vicinity will be alarm calling."

"The breeding ritual includes a dance..
The male and female Axolotl begin the breeding process with a waltz. Essentially it is a dance between the two of them that serves as the initiation phase of mating. Both the male and female will rub and slide against the other’s cloaca while dancing in a circular fashion. The male will eventually drop a cone-shaped mass with a sperm cap. He does this following about 30-seconds of vigorous tail shaking. The female will pick up the deposit with her cloaca following a tail shaking display and fertilization begins."

"Astronomer here! There are (probably) [tardigrades on the moon. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49265125) A few years ago an Israeli satellite accidentally crashed there that had tardigrades on board that likely spilled all over. 

The reason this is interesting is because these are really hearty little creatures that can survive really extreme temperatures and dehydrate into suspended animation. The company that crashed them almost definitely thinks the tardigrades are still alive. So hey, the moon probably has life on it now, and that happened while none of us were paying attention."
"These snakes love to climb trees, and young snakes often hide high in the branches."

"The piranha can devour large animals..
As stated above, only if the animal happens to fall into water infested with piranha will it become dinner. The main reason this happens is because piranhas hunt in groups – very large groups."
Small body and tri-coloured coat!

"To locate food, walruses use their vibrissae (whiskers). A walrus has about 400 to 700 vibrissae on its snout. Vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves. A walrus moves its snout through bottom sediment to find food. Abrasion patterns of the tusks show that they are dragged through the sediment, but are not used to dig up prey. Walruses may also take in mouthfuls of water and squirt powerful jets at the sea floor, excavating burrowing invertebrates such as clams and may consume 3,000 to 6,000 clams within a single feeding."
"They can reproduce parthenogenetically.
This is, of course, one of those inferences. Since we’ve never seen them in action, we don’t know much about their breeding at all, but other, similar beetles can reproduce without sperm."
This hybrid dog is a great companion and doesn’t do well being left alone but is suitable for apartments or houses with backyards!
"They use farts for flotation.
Manatees are mammals, so, unlike bony fish, they don’t have a swim bladder. And unlike sharks, they don’t have a fatty liver or cartilaginous bones. All of these adaptations in other animals tend to function as buoyancy regulators; helping the animal move up and down in the water at will."

The associations of the animals are fluid, often repeated but not constant. Solitary coastal animals are observed in various regions of the world."
"Snow leopards can’t roar.
Even though snow leopards are closely related to tigers, they don’t have the ability to roar like their striped cousins. In fact, they are the only cat in their genus that doesn’t have the ability to roar. This is due to the absence of a pad of fibro-elastic tissue around the larynx that helps to transfer sound energy. This pad lengthens the vocal cords of big cats, increasing the ability to radiate sound. Since snow leopards don’t have this pad, they are limited to growls, hisses, and meows. 4"

"A male song thrush can have over 100 phrases in his repertoire of songs and can imitate pet birds, telephones and other man-made objects."
"Hybrid big cats are known to be fertile..
There is a great deal of documentation on this subject. In fact, the fertility of big cat females includes many different hybrids. There is actually a rule that describes it: in hybrid animals, where their sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one sex is absent, rare or happens to be sterile, the animal will be born heterogametric – the sex that had two different sex chromosomes. It is called Haldane’s Rule. There are other hybrids in the animal kingdom that are actually sterile."
"The ankle bones, or tarsals, of the tarsier are incredibly long"

In open waters, a dolphin pod sometimes encircles a large school of fish and herds them into a tight ball for easy feeding. Then the dolphins take turns charging through the school to feed. Occasionally dolphins will herd fish to shallow water where they are easy prey."
"Once sexually mature, female sea turtles will typically return to the beach area from which they originally hatched. Season after season, the females ascend their ancestral beach to deposit their own clutch. A female turtle digs a pit in the sand using her hind flippers, and deposits dozens of eggs the size of ping pong balls. These eggs then incubate beneath the sand from roughly 1.5 to 2.5 months, at the end of which time the eggs hatch in approximate unison. The newly hatched turtles attempt to scramble to the surface, down the beach, and past the shoreline - with the survivors continuing the cycle of birth, growth, and return."
"Snorkies are known for their funny, attention-getting antics."
"In the wild, group composition and structure are based largely on age, sex, reproductive condition, family relationships and association histories."

Found throughout the South-East Asian jungles!
"There’s a Zonkey too!.
You guessed it, this a hybrid between a Zebra male and a Donkey female."
"The rattle is a series of hard segments made of keratin. A new segment is added each time a snake sheds. When shaken, the segments vibrate against each other, producing a familiar buzz. Unlike other rattlesnakes, which may have loud rattles, pygmies produce a much softer sound (almost a whirring, thus giving them the nickname ""buzzworm""). Often their rattles break off and produce no sound at all."

These groups generally maintain a home range of 12 km2 (4.6 mi2). This home range is regularly patrolled and marked (via the definitive anal glands typifying mustelids)."
"Females are sequential hermaphrodites, which means they can convert to males anytime during their life cycle."
"They’re a relic from the “Age of Fishes”.
Most of the fish species we know and recognise are part of a very different group of fish: the ray-finned fish. These are the mackerel, the trout, the tuna and the flying fish, and pretty much all species of (vertebrate) fish in the sea that aren’t sharks and rays."
"Flamingos can fly!.
Flamingos kept in zoo’s have often had their wings clipped. In the wild, flamingos can fly, and they use their wings to migrate to warmer areas for winter and to search new bodies of water for food."

While exact population numbers of the star-nosed mole are unknown, they are quite common in North America and Canada, and they are classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List. 3"
"Both sexes walk differently.
The sex of many animals is often hard to tell apart. While adult lions and many birds, for example, have distinctly different looks depending on whether they’re male or female, lots of animals look pretty much identical. Usually, if you can tell them apart, it’s only because of a difference in colour or shape."
They have two sets of eyelids!
"Giant hornets build a new nest every year.
Unlike in bees, wasps and hornet queens typically only live for a year. At the beginning of her life, the queen giant hornet will burrow into the ground and wait for Winter to pass before she starts laying eggs. The sterile female hornet larvae that are produced are fed on tree sap until they mature, take over the running of the nest."

"Female echidnas carry their eggs in a pouch.
Female echidnas usually lay a single egg at a time. Shortly after the egg has been laid, the mother transfers the egg to a pouch on her ventral (stomach) surface. She incubates the egg for 10 to 11 days until it hatches. After hatching, the young echidna either travels with the mother in her pouch or remains in a burrow while she forages for food. 8"

They do not fall completely asleep during hibernation but wake up from time to time during the winter to walk around.
"The black caiman, M. niger, is unique among crocodilians in that much of its juvenile coloration - yellowish strips and spots - is retained well into its adult life. This relatively vibrant coloration has caused considerable population pressures for the species as their hide is highly prized in the skin trade."

They genus Ampulex has 130 species which have a general ant-like appearance and mimic the way ants move. Some species are known to copy ants, as they can be considered unpalatable or aggressive by predators. While other ant mimicking is to help hunt ants."
"They help other species survive.
Atlantic wolffish play a crucial role in controlling the populations of green crabs and sea urchins. These species reproduce quickly and can take over an area, consuming so much food that little is available for other animals. Atlantic wolffish reduce the size of crab and urchin populations by feeding on them, ensuring that other species are able to survive."

This is because they have long, curved powerful claws on their forelimbs, which are not as efficient to walk on."
"They are ecosystem engineers.
And in almost every sense of the word! Beavers cause enormous damage to their environment by constructing the dams they use to create their living areas."
"They’re extremely similar to humans and used to help us better understand human conditions.

Female cheetahs will move their cubs to different hiding places every few days. Once the cubs reach 5 or 6 weeks of age, they will follow their mothers and even start eating from their kills. By the time the cubs reach one year of age, they are hunting on their own. At 15 months, they will move away from their mother and either find a mate or sometimes live in a small group."
The leopard seal is named for its spotted coat pattern.
"When males and females call in unison, both point their bills to the sky and the male raises part of his wing over his back and joins the female. The two birds call back and forth for about 10 seconds. Scientists believe these calls reinforce the monogamous pair bond and also serve to defend their territory."
"Their feathers have two shafts.
We know that feathers evolved before flight, but in cassowaries, it’s thought that their lineage once evolved to fly and then lost that ability, rather than following an unbroken lineage of flightless birds."
"Okapis ""chew their cud"" just like cows"
"For more information about gorillas, explore the Gorilla InfoBook."

"One species of dolphin is considered critically endangered..
The Baiji dolphin, which is a river dolphin found in the Yangtze River, has suffered a severe drop in population over the past few decades. The main cause happens to be pollution that has filled the river with contaminants. The river is heavily used by industry in the region.

"Sugar gliders get their name because of the specialized flap connecting the front leg to the hind leg, giving them the ability to glide."
"Meerkats have no body fat.
If you’re wondering why meerkats are so small, it’s because they don’t actually have any body fat."

"Communicating territory in the water is often difficult, but many crocodilians are quite adept at it. Most species use a headslap or jawclap above or beneath the water. A crocodilian performs a headslap by raising its head and slamming it against the surface of the water. Jawclaps are when the reptile opens its jaw in a biting motion at the surface of the water, then quickly closes it. The result is a loud pop and splash."
Crocodiles swallow stones to aid in digestion and to control buoyancy in the water.
"While linnets are monogamous during mating season, they do not mate for life. While breeding pairs are together, the males are highly territorial and will defend the nesting site and the surrounding area."
"Eighty percent of calves (sometimes up to half a million) are born within a 2 to 3 week period at the start of the rainy season. Since predators can only take a limited number of prey at any given time, there is a higher chance of survival for each individual calf."
